This movie was the first of its kind to be released, which emphasized on the diversified population and their living style. It’s about every individual who resides on Earth and their place in the puzzle of humanity. The Director of the movie got the idea to produce such a movie through the performance of musicians who were unknown to each other but moved on to accomplished the cross culture barrier and managed to discover a way to create a beautiful fusion of music. Similarly, the editorial process of the movie was a process of discovery and it was not possible if they would not have opened completely to what all they received from different sources. The movie is a striking example of what happens when creativity and idealism collide. It’s a part vision of how lots of different people doing lots of different things form a global community. These may be some of the idealistic thoughts and factors, based on which the movie was successfully produced.
