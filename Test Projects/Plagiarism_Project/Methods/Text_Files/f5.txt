There are things that divide us as humans, but far more things that unite us. Every day we are alive, there is hope and a choice to see a better future together. I will indeed agree to the point that people all over the world are alike no matter what circumstances divide them when it comes to culture, creed, caste, religion, or sex. We are born as humans, and will die as humans. Every human being has a common set of characters, which can be found in almost every human being that exists today. People as a collective whole or a culture in other words, are very different from each other. However, one on one, person to person, there are more similarities because individually we have very similar needs, wants, concerns and hopes. We have far more similarities than differences, but most often, we focus more on things that are different. If we come with the mindset of love and humanity, we will finally begin to see people for who they truly are and not their external appearances or first impressions.
