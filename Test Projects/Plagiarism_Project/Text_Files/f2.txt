In recent years, we have witnessed robots and machines replacing many jobs that used to be done by people. As technology continues to progress, robots are becoming cleverer than people and computers learn to perform tasks with greater efficiency than us, it is worrying to think that one day robots will be in every work place and there will be less and less jobs available for people. Computers bring many benefits for companies, who make fewer mistakes, save money and work faster and more precisely. This is why many businesses in all fields are beginning to use more machines.
